# Cancer-Predition
This project aims to predict the presence of cancerous cells using machine learning techniques in Python.
The focuses is on developing a predictive model to identify cancerous cells by applying machine learning techniques using Python and the scikit-learn library. The goal is to analyze medical data, such as tumor characteristics, to determine accurately whether cells are malignant or benign.

The approach involves several stages, including data preparation, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. Algorithms implemented include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting. The effectiveness of each algorithm is assessed through evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curves.

By accurately predicting cancer diagnoses, this project assists healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, potentially enabling earlier treatment and improving patient care and prognosis.
